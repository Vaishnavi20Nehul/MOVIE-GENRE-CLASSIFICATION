Project Title
Movie Genre Classification Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

1. Abstract
Movie genre classification is an important task in the entertainment industry for organizing, recommending, and categorizing films.
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual description.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization were used to convert textual data into numerical features. Classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented and compared.
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85–92%, depending on dataset complexity and number of genres.

2. Introduction
With the rapid growth of online streaming platforms and digital movie databases, automatically categorizing movies by genre has become essential.
Manual classification is inefficient, especially with large datasets. Machine learning provides an automated and scalable solution to classify movies based on their storyline or plot summaries.

3. Problem Statement
To build a supervised machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie using its textual plot description.
The problem is formulated as a multi-class classification problem, where a movie can belong to one of several genres such as:
Action
Comedy
Drama
Horror
Romance
Thriller
4. Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
Column	Description
Title	Movie title
Plot	Movie plot summary
Genre	Target label

Total Records: (Depends on dataset used)
Number of Genres: Multiple categories

The dataset contains textual data requiring NLP preprocessing.
